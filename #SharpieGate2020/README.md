This is my final project for DACCS 697DBD, Digital Behavioral Data. I collected 10,174 tweets containing "#SharpieGate" on Nov. 17 2020.

The workflow script is used to collect tweets, and the app script is used to build the shinyapp. The final product can be found at https://larri-miller.shinyapps.io/SharpieGate_2020/ :)
