This is my final project for DACCS 697DBD, Digital Behavioral Data. I collected 10,174 tweets containing "#SharpieGate" on Nov. 17 2020. I used the same dataset to write a proposal for DACCS 695SR, Survey Research Methods. If you are interested in reading this proposal, please contact me.

The scripts I used are based on work provided by Dr. Xu. The workflow script is used to collect tweets, and the app script is used to build the shinyapp. The final product can be found at https://larri-miller.shinyapps.io/SharpieGate_2020/ :)

The code used for my 695SR project is found in the Appendix.rmd file. Note that I have removed my Twitter developer information from these files.
