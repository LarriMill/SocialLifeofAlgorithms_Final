For this project I used network analysis to examine the top content producers for #StopTheSteal. I collected data in multiple batches, including 4,968 tweets on 11/14/2020 and 4,439 tweets on 11/28/2020. Stop_the_steal.rmd shows this process. 

Data Collection_Misinformation Project.rda documents various hashtags that I debated exploring, as well a network analysis of my first #stopthesteal batch.
